      <p>This page is dedicated to information about each launch.</p>  

    <div class="information">
      <p>The first launch occurred on the 28th of June 1969 at (TIME)(TIMEZONE). It was a suborbital test flight for the first and second stages. The third stage was present but inert. It carried a cylindrical dummy payload and lacked the signature red-orange paint on the fairings. Immediately after launch, the rocket began to quickly oscillate back and forth. Roughly a minute into flight, the fairing broke away and the payload was ripped from the vehicle. The engine on the first stage then seized to function. The unpowered rocket tumbled as it fell. The vehicle was then remotely destroyed at an altitude of about 3km.
      The flight data sent over radio from the vehicle indicated that one of the four Gamma 8 engine pairs had been repeatedly moving between its maximum and minimum range.</p>
