    <div class="information">
      <h3 class="labelheader">First launch - R0</h3>
      <p>The first launch occurred on the 28th of June 1969 at (TIME)(TIMEZONE). It was a suborbital test flight for the first and second stages. The third stage was present but inert. It carried a cylindrical dummy payload and lacked the signature red-orange paint on the fairings. Immediately after launch, the rocket began to quickly oscillate back and forth. Roughly a minute into flight, the fairing broke away and the payload was ripped from the vehicle. The engine on the first stage then seized to function. The unpowered rocket tumbled as it fell. The vehicle was then remotely destroyed at an altitude of about 3km.
      The flight data sent over radio from the vehicle indicated that one of the four Gamma 8 engine pairs had been repeatedly moving between its maximum and minimum range.</p>

      <h3 class="labelheader">Second launch - R1</h3>
      <p>The second launch occurred on the 3rd of March 1970 at (TIME)(TIMEZONE). It was a repeat of the previous launch, being a test flight of both the first and second stages. It was originally planned to launch the developmental satellite X2. After the result of the first flight however, it was reconfigured to R0 specifications. The fairings were painted orange to increase their visibility.</p>
